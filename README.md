### Extensions
#### Plugins
- Check if any plugin has been changed in this last release:

> $ git log --oneline --after={2013-04-18} --no-merges --name-only | grep 'plugins\/.*' | cut -d/ -f2,3 | sort | uniq

_Or Compare across versions_

> git log --oneline 1.4/dev19...develop --no-merges --name-only | grep 'plugins\/.*' | cut -d/ -f2,3 | sort | uniq > /var/www/packages/plugins.log

- if plungins have been modified:
 - Update the release number in their manifest .xml file with the same release number as the component. For example if we are releasing redSHOP 1.3 and plugin plg_default_shipping has been updated during 1.2 - 1.3 period, then you should set the plugin version to 1.3 here: https://github.com/redCOMPONENT-COM/redSHOP-1.2/blob/master/plugins/redshop_shipping/default_shipping/default_shipping.xml#L4 or leave it as it is if it has not been touch.
