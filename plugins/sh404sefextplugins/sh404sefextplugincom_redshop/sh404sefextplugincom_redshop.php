/**
 * Sample sh404SEF extension plugin.
 * This is a standard Joomla! plugin. Install it using
 * Joomla! installer. It will be loaded in the sh404sefextplugins group.
 *
 * Upon upgrading sh404SEF to a new version, this plugin will be
 * preserved, because it is independant from sh404SEF. This means you
 * can use this method to provide plugins for extension that do not
 * have support for sh404SEF, or just as well override one of the
 * plugins that come with sh404SEF, should you have a need for customized SEF URLs
 *
 * Note that the same mechanism applies for meta ext plugin. See the
 * source code file for the Sh404sefClassBaseextplugin class
 *
 * Note also that:
 *    - you do not need to include or require the Sh404sefClassBaseextplugin class file,
 *    sh404SEF autoloading mechanism takes care of everything
 *    - likewise, this plugin does not need to be published, it will
 *    be used even if unpublished. To deactivate it, just uninstall it
 *
 * @since  2.1
