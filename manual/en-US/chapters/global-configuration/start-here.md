## redSHOP Configuration - Overview - START HERE!
redSHOP is a powerful and robust system, and as such, has many configuration options to choose from.  Many defaults have been set according to frequently used options, however, you will most likely want to set your own preferences for your shop.

redSHOP Configuration can be accessed by logging in to Joomla and going to the Components -> redSHOP link, and then clicking on the Configuration button or clicks at "Configuration" select on "redSHOP Configuration" : Once you access the Configuration screen you will have 13 tabs for settings, and a 14th tab that will present configuration and server information:
