<ul>
<li><b>Enable Manufacturer e-mail - </b>Set whether manufacturers should be notified by email when products that have been assigned to them have been sold on the online store. For this feature to work, as this is an automated feature, the product needs to be assigned to a manufacturer, and the manufacturer's email address needs to be stored in the manufacturer's details. 

<li><b>Available options: </b>No, Yes

<li><b>Enable Supplier Email - </b>Set whether suppliers should be notified by email when products that have been assigned to them have been sold on the online store. For this feature to work, as this is an automated feature, the product needs to be assigned to a supplier, and the supplier's email address needs to be stored in the suppliers's details. 

<li><b>Available options: </b>No, Yes

<li><b>Default Manufacturer Template - </b>The default template used to display manufacturer product pages within the product catalog on the front end. The shop administrator can select from a list of available "Manufacturer Products" templates in the "Templates" section to apply to all manufacturer product pages in general, and this same template will be used when using the "Standard Manufacturer Products Layout" menu item, however it is possible to overrule this selection and specify templates on a per-manufacturer basis within the manufacturer's details. More information on category details is available in the Manufacturer section.

<li><b>Default  Sorting of Manufacturers  - </b>The default order in which manufacturers are sorted and displayed on the "manufacturers" page within the product catalog on the front end. The customer can modify this ordering to their preference when the "Product Sort Order" dropdown selection box is available on the category page, however the shop administrator can set the initial / default sorting according to:
    <ul>
    <li><b>Alphabetically - </b>this setting will list manufacturers based on alphabetical order
    <li><b>Newest - </b>this setting will list manufacturers based on the date they were created and published, starting with the latest and ending with the oldest
    <li><b>Order - </b>this setting will list manufacturers based on the "Order" value the shop administrator has assigned to them in the back end.
    </ul>

<li><b>Default Sorting of Products in Manufacturer View  - </b>The default order in which products are sorted and displayed on the manufacturer product pages within the product catalog on the front end. The customer can modify this ordering to their preference when the "Product Sort Order" dropdown selection box is available on the category page, however the shop administrator can set the initial / default sorting according to:
    <ul>
    <li><b>Product Name - </b>this setting will list products based on alphabetical order
    <li><b>Price, ascending - </b>this setting will list products based on price in ascending order, starting with the lowest price and ending with the highest
    <li><b>Price, descending - </b>this setting will list products based on price in descending order, starting with the highest price and ending with the lowest
    <li><b>Product Number - </b>this setting will list products based on their assigned product number (SKU), starting with the lowest number and ending with the highest
    <li><b>Newest - </b>this setting will list products based on the date they were created and published, starting with the latest and ending with the oldest
    <li><b>Order - </b>this setting will list products based on the "Order" value the shop administrator has assigned to them in the back end.
    </ul>

<li><b>Max. Characters for Manufacturer Title  - </b>The maximum number of characters that are displayed for the "Manufacturer Title" text wherever manufacturers are displayed within the product catalog on the front end. Setting this value to 40, for example, will mean only the first 40 characters of the manufacturer title will be displayed, even if the text cuts off mid-word or mid-sentence. This feature should be used in conjunction with the "Manufacturer Title Suffix" setting that offers the shop administrator the opportunity to append a symbol or other character to indicate to the customer that there is more to the title than is currently being displayed.

<li><b>Manufacturer Title Suffix  - </b>The suffix that is appended to the "Manufacturer Title" text when the character limit set by the "Max. Characters for Manufacturer Title" has been reached. Setting this value as ..., for example, will display the product title, the length defined by the above setting, followed by "..." to imply there is more text available that cannot be displayed at the moment. This is useful for when the shop administrator has limited space on the web page for the complete title to be displayed, while letting the customer know that there is more text to the title available.
