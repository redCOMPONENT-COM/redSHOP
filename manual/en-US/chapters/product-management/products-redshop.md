<h4>redPRODUCTFINDER Association</h4>
This tab will appear if you have redPRODUCTFINDER installed, and makes it simple to associate this product with specific product finder tags that the customers can use to narrow down their selection. When you have set up a form and have defined some types and tags to go with it, a list of those types will appear in this tab with the "Type:" label next to each name. Move the mouse cursor over the type name and the mouse icon will change to a hand, indicating you can click on it to open a panel that will display the tags you can associate this product with, the "quality score" value that defines the weight and priority given to the association when calculating relevance to search results, and a list of tags that you can assign dependencies to, meaning the customer will have to search using another tag for the product association with this one to be relevant.
