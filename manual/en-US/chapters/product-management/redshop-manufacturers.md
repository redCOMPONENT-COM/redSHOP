## Working with redSHOP Manufacturers
When designing your product catalog, a good place to start would be the manufacturers section. Manufacturers represent the people or companies that have created the products which are available on the catalog, and as such it is recommended that we start building up our product catalog by listing the manufacturers and their details. Adding manufacturers to redSHOP is simple and effective, and comes with various benefits.

<h4 id="access-seo">Page Access and SEO</h4>
In the event that there will be multiple administrators working with the backend of redSHOP, it is possible to restrict access to the manufacturer section, as well as define the permissions given to view and modify details, from within the "backend access management" section of redSHOP. This section must be enabled from within the redSHOP global configuration to be available, and this feature requires that shop administrators be assigned to at least one Joomla! backend user group. Simply access the backend access management section from the Main menu button or the left-hand navigation panel and then click on the manufacturers link, where you will be presented with options to limit the user groups that have access to the manufacturer section as well as their permission to view, create, modify and delete manufacturer records and details.<br><br>

In addition to the SEO settings that can be configured for individual manufacturer pages, you can also set up global defaults from the manufacturer section within redSHOP's global configuration 'SEO' tab. It is possible to create 'templates' for redSHOP to follow in automatically constructing page titles, headings, meta-keywords and meta-descriptions, and there are several tags to choose from that represents specific types of information that will be generated when the page loads on the front-end. These global settings will apply for all manufacturer pages except those who have their own individual SEO settings defined in which case those will be used instead.<br><br>

<h4 id="templates-tags">Templates and tags</h4>
There are several options within redSHOP's global configuration section that affect the look and layout of manufacturer related pages on the front-end. Within the 'layout' tab, you can modify the default sort order in which manufacturers are displayed, the default sort order of products displayed in the manufacturer product page, the maximum number of characters that should appear in the manufacturers name and a suffix to act as an indicator that there is more of the name that isn't being displayed. Within the 'images' tab, you can configure the dimensions of the manufacturer image thumbnail as well as up to three variations of dimensions for the product thumbnails on the manufacturer product page, and you can set if you would like to watermark either of the two.<br><br>

While it is possible to assign a manufacturer their image or logo from the manufacturer listings page, it is also possible to upload manufacturer images in bulk from within redSHOP's media management section. To access it, click on the media button on redSHOP's main menu or the media list link from within the left-hand navigation panel, and you will end up in the media management screen. To display only the images associated to manufacturers, you can use the "media section" drop-down to filter and display only manufacturer related media.<br><br>

You can create custom fields for various sections throughout redSHOP, including manufacturer pages. To access the custom field section, click on the custom fields button or the custom field list in the left-hand navigation panel, either of which would lead you to the custom field management screen. You can use the 'field section' drop-down to filter and display only those custom fields that have been assigned to the manufacturer section. To create a new custom manufacturer field, click on the new button or the 'add custom field' link and use the 'section' drop-down to select manufacturer when defining the custom field settings. More information on how custom fields work is available in the custom fields section.<br><br>

When designing the look of the front-end product catalog, there are three pages specific to manufacturers whose templates can be modified:<br><br>

<ul>
<li><b>Manufacturer List - </b>the page that focuses on all manufacturer and show some information basic
<img src="./manual/en-US/chapters/product-management/img/img58.png" class="example"/><br><br>

<li>View in frontend with layout manufacturer list. It can modify custom ideas
<img src="./manual/en-US/chapters/product-management/img/img59.png" class="example"/><br><br>

<li><b>Manufacturer detail - </b>the page that focuses on a particular manufacturer and their details 
<img src="./manual/en-US/chapters/product-management/img/img60.png" class="example"/><br><br>

<li>View in frontend with layout manufacturer detail. It can modify custom ideas
<img src="./manual/en-US/chapters/product-management/img/img61.png" class="example"/><br><br>

<li><b>Manufacturer products - </b>the page that focuses on a particular manufacturers products, i.e. displays the products that have been assigned to that manufacturer
<img src="./manual/en-US/chapters/product-management/img/img62.png" class="example"/><br><br>

<li>View in frontend with layout manufacturer product list. It can modify custom ideas
<img src="./manual/en-US/chapters/product-management/img/img63.png" class="example"/><br><br>
</ul>

You can set the default manufacturer template from within the 'product/category' tab in redSHOP's global configuration, as well as assign specific manufacturer product templates to each manufacturer in their respective details pages. You can make specific links for your customers to view any one of these three pages from within Joomla!'s menu manager and using the available redSHOP manufacturer menu items, with menu item parameters that define the name of the specific manufacturer, the number of manufacturers and products to display.<br><br>

Another way to display and link to your manufacturers is to use the manufacturer module which comes with the redCOMPONENT subscription. With redSHOP’s Manufacturer module you can display your manufacturers in a scroller, with various controls to modify the manufacturer detail template within the scroller and the scroller properties itself. For the scroller template, you can choose the number of manufacturers to display, their names, links and images, and whether you’d like the image to link to the manufacturer’s details or to their products. For the scroller properties, you can define dimensions and the speed of animation, as well as how the scroller will list the manufacturers once the customer has scrolled through all of them.
