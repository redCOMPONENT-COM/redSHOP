## VAT/Tax Group
Germany and France were the first countries to implement VAT, doing so in the form of a general consumption tax during World War I. A  value-added tax (VAT), known in some countries as a goods and services tax (GST), is a type of tax that is assessed incrementally. Like an income tax, it is based on the increase in value of a product or service at each stage of production or distribution. However, a VAT is collected by the end retailer and is usually a flat tax, and is therefore frequently compared to a sales tax.

VAT essentially compensates for the shared services and infrastructure provided in a certain locality by a state and funded by its taxpayers that were used in the elaboration of that product or service. Not all localities require VAT to be charged and goods and services for export may be exempted (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duty_free">duty free</a>). VAT is usually implemented as a destination-based tax, where the tax rate is based on the location of the consumer and applied to the sales price. Confusingly, the terms VAT, GST, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumption_tax">consumption tax</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sales_tax">Sales tax</a> are sometimes used interchangeably. VAT raises about a fifth of total tax revenues both worldwide and among the members of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organisation_for_Economic_Co-operation_and_Development">Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development</a> (OECD).[1]:14 As of 2018, 166 of the 193 countries with full UN membership employ a VAT, including all OECD members except the United States,[1]:14 which uses a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sales_tax">sales tax</a> system instead.
