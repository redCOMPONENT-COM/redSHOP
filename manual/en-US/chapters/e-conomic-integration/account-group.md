## Account Group
After we have configured the initial settings in "redSHOP Configuration", the next step is create account groups in e-conomic, so we can assign an account group to a product in redshop and e-conomic. redSHOP by default has a default account group as below image (change it based on your real information)

To create a new one:  click on left menu item "Add e-conomic Product Group", or click on "New" button at the top toolbar, you will be redirected to the new/edit landing page, as below screenshot:
