## redSHOP Main Menu
The Main Menu is usually the starting point for any administrator working with redSHOP, as it acts as a central hub linking the administrator to all of redSHOP's sections, the "Global Configuration" and "Configuration Wizard" settings, and any statistics that have been enabled for display within the Main Menu itself. Except for the configuration settings screens, all sections within redSHOP are also accessible via the Navigation Sidebar, discussed further later in this article.

The Main Menu is currently accessible in one of two ways:

<ul>
<li>The "redSHOP" component link that is placed in the Joomla! "Components" menu upon installation of redSHOP, and

<li>The "Proceed to Shop" link that is displayed on redSHOP's post-install screen.
