## redSHOP Navigation Panel
While the Main Menu offers the shop administrator a central hub from which to access the various sections within redSHOP, it does not offer the full range of links and functions available within each section, nor should it as it it meant to act as an overview. To access the full range of links and functions for each section, there is the Navigation Sidebar. This sidebar appears on the left-hand side of the screen in the majority of redSHOP pages in the back end, with the exception of:

Details screens, such as when the shop administrator is adding or editing specific item or section details (for example when adding or editing a product's details)
