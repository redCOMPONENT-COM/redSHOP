## Using WYSIWYG Editors with redSHOP
On many of the forms that the shop administrator can access and use to modify details within certain sections, an HTML-rich text editor (also known as a WYSIWYG editor) will be displayed that will allow the shop administrator to insert and modify containing HTML tags and formatting while using convenient and user-friendly graphical toolbars to assist those entering content and are not comfortable working with HTML formatting tags directly. Each WYSIWYG editor offers essentially the same features, however each one has a different take on how to offer them and how to design the toolbars.

### Default Joomla Editors
Within Joomla!'s own Global Configuration section (accessed through the Joomla menu, System -> Global Configuration), there is a setting labelled "Default WYSIWYG Editor" that lists all WYSIWYG text editors currently installed and enabled in the Plugin Manager (as WYSIWYG editors fall under the category of "editor"-type plugins). This setting determines the WYSIWYG editor that will be used across the site, both in the front and back end. Registered users can change their individual preference of WYSIWYG editor if the shop administrator so chooses to offer that ability.

By default, Joomla! comes installed with three editor plugins, two of them enabled and active and one as another alternative that must be enabled before available to use:

<b>Editor - No Editor - </b>When selected, this will display a standard, plain textarea wherever WYSIWYG editors are meant to be displayed. This editor type should only be used in situation where there is an issue saving content created within a WYSIWYG editor or if the editor is causing undesired issues such as unexpected behavior while using the editor or content re-arrangement and/or corruption upon save. 

<b>Editor - TinyMCE - </b>When selected, this will display the TinyMCE WYSIWYG editor. (Details to follow)

<b>CodeMirror - </b>CodeMirror is a code editor for your Joomla! site which is rich in code features for editing HTML, especially redSHOP templates. It can highlight the code of a lot of languages (HTML being the primary interest for Joomla!) , show you mismatched tags and also helps you have a clear indentation for your code.

#### The redTEAM recommends the use of CodeMirror or no editor at all if any issues editing the code of redSHOP templates arise.

### Other popular editors for Joomla include:
<b>JCE - </b>"An award-winning, configurable WYSIWYG editor for Joomla! based on Moxiecode's TinyMCE. Includes advanced Image/Media, File and Link handling, plugin support, and an Administration interface for editor configuration.".

<b>JCK Editor - </b>"The new JCK architecture, marks the next generation of internet based editors. Its performance is truly amazing, thanks to its plug-n-play state-of-the-art JavaScript API and is much more than an ‘Out of the Box’ installation of the CKeditor! Developers can now choose what plug-ins, tool-bars and configure the editor for real-time editing with ease, via a collections of config files."

<b>RokPad - </b>"RokPad was devised as a tool to provide an easy and elegant interface for editing Joomla content, to make it a pleasure, not a chore. Advanced functions such as an Ajax saving action, plus shortcut keys, are incredible some of the many time saving features. RokPad is perfect for anyone who prefers to avoid the WYSIWYG editors but still craves the richness of a code editor."
