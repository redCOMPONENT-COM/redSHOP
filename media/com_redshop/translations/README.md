# Translation Files (redCORE)

redSHOP 1.5 is not multilingual by default, but you can activate the translation feature using redCORE.

The files located in this folder can be added to redCORE in order to be able to translate redSHOP elements: products, manufacturers, categories, attributes, etc.

redCORE is a free tool from redCOMPONENT.com that enhances Joomla Core. Learn more about redCORE at http://redcomponent-com.github.io/redCORE/?chapters/introduction.md
